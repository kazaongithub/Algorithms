How to remove duplicates elements from a list or array ?
========================================================

  Best solution is to use a hash.

  When you think the words "unique" or "duplicated",
  think "hash keys".

  If you don't care about order of the elements,
  you could just create the hash and then extract the keys.

  It's not important how you create the hash.
  Just that you use "keys" to get the unique elements.

  my %hash = map { $_, 1 } @array;
  # or a hash slice: @hash{ @array } = ();
  # or a foreach: $hash{$_} = 1 foreach ( @array );

  my @unique = keys %hash;
